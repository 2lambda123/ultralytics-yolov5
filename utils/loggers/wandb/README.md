## About Weights & Biases
Think of [W&B](https://wandb.ai/site?utm_campaign=repo_yolo_wandbtutorial) like GitHub for machine learning models. With a few lines of code, save everything you need to debug, compare and reproduce your models â€” architecture, hyperparameters, git commits, model weights, GPU usage, and even datasets and predictions.
  
 Used by top researchers including teams at OpenAI, Lyft, Github, and MILA, W&B is part of the new standard of best practices for machine learning. How W&B can help you optimize your machine learning workflows:
 
 * [Debug](https://wandb.ai/wandb/getting-started/reports/Visualize-Debug-Machine-Learning-Models--VmlldzoyNzY5MDk#Free-2) model performance in real time
 * [GPU usage](https://wandb.ai/wandb/getting-started/reports/Visualize-Debug-Machine-Learning-Models--VmlldzoyNzY5MDk#System-4), visualized automatically
 * [Custom charts](https://wandb.ai/wandb/customizable-charts/reports/Powerful-Custom-Charts-To-Debug-Model-Peformance--VmlldzoyNzY4ODI) for powerful, extensible visualization
 * [Share insights](https://wandb.ai/wandb/getting-started/reports/Visualize-Debug-Machine-Learning-Models--VmlldzoyNzY5MDk#Share-8) interactively with collaborators
 * [Optimize hyperparameters](https://docs.wandb.com/sweeps) efficiently
 * [Track](https://docs.wandb.com/artifacts) datasets, pipelines, and production models

<summary>## First-Time Setup</summary>
When you first train, W&B will prompt you to create a new account and will generate an **API key** for you. If you are an existing user you can retrieve your key from https://wandb.ai/authorize. This key is used to tell W&B where to log your data. You only need to supply your key once, and then it is remembered on the same device.
 
 W&B will create a cloud **project** (default is 'YOLOv5') for your training runs, and each new training run will be provided a unique run **name** within that project as project/name. You can also manually set your project and run name as:
 
 ```shell
 $ python train.py --project ... --name ...
 ```

<summary> ## Viewing Runs </summary>
 Run information streams from your environment to the W&B cloud console as you train. This allows you to monitor and even cancel runs in **realtime**. All important information is logged:
 
 * Training & Validation losses
 * Metrics: Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95
 * Learning Rate over time
 * A bounding box debugging panel, showing the training progress over time
 * GPU: Type, **GPU Utilization**, power, temperature, **CUDA memory usage**
 * System: Disk I/0, CPU utilization, RAM memory usage
 * Your trained model as W&B Artifact
 * Environment: OS and Python types, Git repository and state, **training command**

 ## Reports
 W&B Reports can be created from your saved runs for sharing online. Once a report is created you will receive a link you can use to publically share your results. Here is an example report created from the COCO128 tutorial trainings of all four YOLOv5 models ([link](https://wandb.ai/glenn-jocher/yolov5_tutorial/reports/YOLOv5-COCO128-Tutorial-Results--VmlldzozMDI5OTY)).
